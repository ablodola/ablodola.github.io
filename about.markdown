Selaba Biz is a blog where you’ll find interviews with artists living in Cambodia, conversations about creativity, technology and entrepreneurship.

I’m interested in finding out what role technology has to play in fostering the next generation of artist in Cambodia and beyond and what it means to be a creative in a global digital age.

Throughout these conversations, I hope to better understand:
The challenges, opportunities and inspiration that for artists face 
Better understanding the impact of technology for artists and creatives
But most importantly, to find out what role technology will play in nurturing the next generation of artists in Cambodia and beyond.

Artists, film makers, photographers, musicians and creatives of any kind are all welcome to reach out.

If you are doing something no one else is doing and people are calling you crazy, well, you might want to talk to a professional, but feel free to send me a polite email to what I like to call the “crazy box” and tell me what you are creating. Who knows, maybe you’re not crazy and you don’t need to see a professional. You might need new friends though.
