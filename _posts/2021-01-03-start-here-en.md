It’s time to say goodbye to the telegraph and learn how to use the internet. That is, in a nutshell, the proverbial seed from which this blog germinated, a blog about art, creativity and business.

It also stems from a compulsive need to find solutions and a desire to share what I have/know to help people turn their ideas into achievements. As far as this blog is concerned, I’m just someone interested in finding ways to help creative people grow as artists.

I did a short stint in a digital marketing agency for musicians some 10 years ago. This was right around the time where the inevitability of social media was imposing itself and more was being demanded from musicians. The musician entrepreneur not only needs to be a damn good musician but also a strategic thinker. 

The same can be said of any artist or creative today. Being good at what you do is rarely enough. Some might think it’s asking a lot of artists to do so much and that “artist entrepreneur” is a nauseating neologism. And I would agree on both counts. But it is what it is, and there’s absolutely no point pissing and moaning about it. 

With this in mind, I plan to interview artists and decision makers in Cambodia. My aim is to understand: what it means to be an artist in the Kingdom today; their underlying aspirations and expectations; and what can be done to encourage the next generation of creatives.

You can expect conversations with and insight from: artists of all kinds, all flavors of designers, musicians and filmmakers as well as the too-often-overlooked crafts people. Hopefully, I will also have the opportunity to talk with private and institutional influencers and decision makers. This includes creative directors, journalists, gallery owners and more, always with the same goal in mind: to share their knowledge and experience with the next generation of artists in Cambodia.

This blog is my modest contribution to the art community in Cambodia. I intend to create a space where creativity and business aren’t antithetical and lift the taboos around talking about art, money and marketing. 

I’m not an artist myself, though I do have a “once up a time” background in music. I’m not an art critic either, though I do have sensibilities of my own, just like anyone else. In my eyes,  art brings people together. It’s a reminder of something we all have in common but find difficult to articulate. 

My name is Selaba. I’m just a messenger.
