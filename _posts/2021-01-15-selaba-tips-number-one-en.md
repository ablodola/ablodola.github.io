If you are a creative of any kind today and you do not have a website or social media, then you might as well not exist.

Don’t forget to read until the end for an extra bonus tip.

<h2>No more excuses</h2>
The internet isn’t so hard to use anymore. 5 or 10 years ago you might have been able to find an excuse but short of not having access to a laptop, there are no excuses anymore.

Platforms such as Wordpress offer powerful tools to build websites. Any problem you have, or any question, you’ll find an answer to on Google Search or Youtube. The best part is, websites such as Godaddy are one-stop-shops, where you can purchase in just a few clicks your domain, hosting and wordpress integration. Easy.  And there are literally thousands of Wordpress themes available online, many for free, for you to customize you site.

<blockquote><h3>“<em>TIP #1: Start by finding a simple theme for your website and focus your attention on creating and structuring your content.</em></h3></blockquote>

<h2>What’s the big deal about having a website?</h2>
The internet offers the possibility to connect with billions of people around the world. Thanks to a website or social media account, anyone can share whatever they like. The possibilities are endless (link). 

A website can be used to showcase your creations, or host an online shop or blog. In any case, it lets the world know you exist. More interestingly, it can automatically serve as a hub for a community of which you’re the de facto leader. If you decide to nurture and grow your community, that can be a lot of power.

A website is important because it is a space in the public eye you control 100%. Social media platforms, such as Facebook or Instagram, are equally important. However, you don’t have the same level of control.

A website isn’t absolutely essential but it provides a sense of legitimacy social media doesn’t bring. In other words, it makes you look more legit and professional.

<blockquote><h3>“<em>TIP#2: Look at your website as a place for people to find out about who you are, what you do and why as well as how to contact you.</em></h3></blockquote>

<h2>What about social media?</h2>
Facebook and Instagram are at the very heart of how Cambodians experience the internet and are used by billions of people worldwide. If you are not on at least one of these then you might as well not exist in this world. It’s usually a lot more work than people expect. 

The name of the game is to increase both your audience and your engagement. How you do that depends on who you are and what you do. 

<blockquote><h3>“<em>TIP #3: Facebook and Instagram are obvious choices but also check out smaller more specialized platforms.</em></h3></blockquote>

<h2>Where should I start?</h2>
The very first place to start is making sure you define who you are, what you do and why you do it. Once you have that figured out, Facebook and Instagram offer the quickest way to get up and going. Make sure you set up your page correctly. Pay attention to the details: pick an appealing cover photo, fill as much of the “about” section as you can and make the most of the “view page as visitor” option to understand what your visitors actually see.  

A Facebook place or Instagram account are great places to get started and get some attention while you work on your website. If you have the time, set up both but don’t forget to customize your content for each platform.

This is just the beginning. A website doesn’t have to be expensive or complicated to set up. If you are motivated to learn, you’ll be surprised by what you’re able to achieve. Don’t start with complicated designs and fancy features. You wan’t visitors to be impressed by your work, not your website.
 
<blockquote><h3>“<em>BONUS TIP: Always do a quick Google search for coupons and vouchers before purchasing your domain/hosting/wordpress. There’s usually a nice discount available ;)</em></h3></blockquote>
